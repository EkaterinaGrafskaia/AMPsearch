# AMPsearch
There are several useful scripts for working with peptides, proteins or any amino acid sequence of natural amino acids to identify AMPs.

motifs.py
This is a Python script that is designed for finding motifs that occur in a sequence.

PhysChemProp.R
This is a R script that is helping to retrieve physico-chemical properties and amino acids composition of your amino acids sequences.

# Usage
motifs.py use file of your amino acids sequences in fasta format and file with motifs to scan for. The output file is in csv format.
PhysChemProp.R use file of your amino acids sequences in fasta format. The outputs files are in csv format.
